üêã WhaleSellTrap

WhaleSellTrap is a Drosera
 smart trap designed to detect large sell-offs of a specific ERC20 token into a liquidity pool on the Hoodi network.

When the pool‚Äôs token balance suddenly increases by a significant amount, it indicates a whale has sold a large volume of tokens ‚Äî and the trap responds automatically.

üß† How It Works

Collect phase ‚Äì The trap queries the ERC20 token‚Äôs balanceOf(pool) to see how many tokens are currently in the pool.

Compare phase ‚Äì If the balance rises sharply (by ‚â• 50,000 tokens), it infers a whale just sold.

Respond phase ‚Äì Calls the respondToWhaleSell() function on your response contract, which can log or trigger any custom behavior.
